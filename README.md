# FetalHealthAI: Precision Diagnosis System

Fetal disease is a crucial healthcare problem which is faced by most of the females and infants in the world. As per studies, various types of healthcare solutions were provided to cope up with this problem. Doctors and physicians
are providing various high tech solutions for these type of critical problems. In terms of survey done in United States, the mortality rate among infant babies has dropped 14% during the period of 2007 to 2017. Various low economy 
countries donâ€™t have feasible tools to deal with these type of disease which results in  repercussions of many infant babies and pregnant women. Nowadays, Machine learning and deep learning are niche areas which are
contributing into various fields such as science agriculture, finance and various medical fields. Artificial intelligence has overcome the problem of complex use cases which cannot be solved by a homo sapiens. Physicians and Surgeons are
required much more time to diagnose a disease when compared with a machine learning model for various use cases like detection, classification and segmentation. Data generation is rapidly increasing which is contributing a major hand in
development of various gadgets and electronic instruments for betterment of the society. Medical field is getting a major contribution from machine learning and deep learning. Various critical diseases like breast cancer detection, tuberculosis
detection, brain tumor detection and skin cancer detection are major issues which are getting a major contribution from the field of machine learning, computer vision and deep learning.
In this project, we will be contributing into the medical field where we will be dealing with the problem of fetal disease classification. Fetal disease is a major issue among females and infants and this classification system will help
them to have an idea about their fetal disease stage. This classification system is developed by considering the low computational cost with better efficacy and accurate results. As per the dataset gathered fetal disease can be classified into
three categories: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological. Dataset was preprocessed by using MinMax Scaling and for dimensionality reduction Principal component analysis and auto encoders were considered. In terms of implementation, 11
standard machine learning algorithms were considered for classifying the fetal stages. Various types of performances metrics were considered for the selection of best classification model. By the real world deployment of this classification
system, physicians can have a feasible tools for diagnosis of fetal health diseases
